# name-variant-creator
Creates five different variations of a given name systematically. 

The original purpose of this script was to create variants of a screen names for a machine learning classification problem (dissertation). 

The script currently creates five simple alterations. 

1. Replaces all instances of a letter with another in the alphabet.
2. Removes one character from name iteratively.
3. Adds one character to name iteratively.
4. Substitutes one character to name iteratively.
5. Swaps adjacent characters iteratively.

After inputting a single name - and pressing enter twice - the deduplicated list of results will be printed.
